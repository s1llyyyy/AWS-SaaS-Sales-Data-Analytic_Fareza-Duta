## **Problem Statements**

---

In the competitive landscape of Software as a Service (SaaS), understanding customer behavior, subscription patterns, and revenue trends is crucial for sustaining growth and improving customer retention. Despite the advantages of a subscription-based model, many SaaS companies face challenges in accurately forecasting revenue, identifying churn risks, and optimizing pricing strategies.

The goal of this data analysis project is to leverage existing customer and transaction data to:

- Analyze sales and profit performance to identify the company's performance by determining the most profitable and least profitable products.
- Analyze customer segments based on their purchase patterns and map the distribution of customers.
- Identify key factors that can boost sales and profit.

>By addressing these areas, the project aims to enhance our understanding of customer behavior, improve retention strategies, optimize product offerings, and drive sustainable growth in our SaaS business.
